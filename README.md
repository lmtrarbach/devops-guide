## Topics

### Linux & Culture

- Linux operating system

- Lean culture and principles

### Tooling

- Source control management (e.g., Git, SVN)

- Build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle)

- Testing tools (e.g., JUnit, TestNG)

- Containerization tools (e.g., Docker, Podman)

- Container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)

- Configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet)

- Infrastructure as Code tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation)

### Networking

- Network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS)

- IP addressing and subnetting

- DNS (Domain Name System)

- Load balancing

- Network security (e.g., firewalls, VPNs)

### Kubernetes

- Kubernetes architecture and components

- Deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes

- Kubernetes resources (e.g., pods, services, deployments)

- Kubernetes operators and controllers

### Filesystems

- Different types of file systems (e.g., ext4, XFS, NTFS)

- File permissions and ownership

- Filesystem security

## Getting Started

To get started with DevOps, you should focus on learning the basics of Linux and Lean culture, as well as mastering the key tools and technologies used in the field. The mind map above provides a useful overview of the different areas to focus on, and the subtopics that fall under each area.

Once you've mastered the basics, you can start exploring more advanced topics like cloud native development, advanced Kubernetes features, and more. Good luck on your DevOps journey!
